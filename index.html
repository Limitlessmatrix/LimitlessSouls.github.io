        <p> This man is quite a charater. He worships the sun and is very friendly. I played a lot offline when I didn't have internet and he is a great co-op partner.  </p>

        <p> The Abyss Walker: <br> This is by far one of my favorites. He was rummored to have stopped a great darkess in the first Dark Souls game. <br> 
            The truth turns out he was consumed by the darkness and driven insane. His armor is the best at least for my playstyle. I also think he is pretty stylish. <br> He is so popular in the Dark Souls gaming community that his armor appears aross all the games. </p>

        <p > She is by far the cutest fire keeper. Fire Keepers keep the flames of a bonfire lit. <br> A bonfire is where you wake up when you die. There are some bonfires you can light. The reason she is my favorite one is because she's got style. <br> 
            Plus, she isn't just a fire keeper but the product of experimenation by the previous kings of the flame. In Dark Souls II if you finish the game and DLC you find a way to become immortal. Normally the Fire Keeper that Levels you up like this becomes the Queen.  </p><br>
            <br> She is also a little more motivating then the other charaters that level you up.
